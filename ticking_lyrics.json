{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Ticking par Zach Bryan\r\nI'm cuttin' ties with things that bind my heart to this world\nI love you and I'm willin' but I cannot keep you, girl\nPhilly by the morning and Ohio by the night\nThe thing about a long rope is you can't hold on too tight\n\nWooden floors and coffee cups\nStepped on and all used up\nBut I reckon that's what mornings are for\nAnd everyone thinks they know me now\nIn these close-minded leave-me towns\nBut I'm too young to even know myself\n\nThere's wheels runnin' down the interstate\n\nLord, I'll wait another day, 'cause I ain't close to you\nThere's time tickin' on the interstate\nAnd Lord, I hate that I ain't close to you\n\nAnd all my friends have moved away\nSome got jobs and some got saved\nThey talk to me like I'm still that kid\nThe fightin', fiendin', Okie son\nThe restless, reckless, hopeful one\nWho once was proud of everything he did\nDo you remember twenty-five\nLong legs and lovin' time?\nSeems like ten lifetimes ago\nI'm cuttin' ties with things that bind my heart to this world\nI love you and I'm willin', but I really have to go\n\n\nThere's wheels runnin' down the interstate\nBut, Lord, I'll wait another day, 'cause I ain't close to you\nThere's time tickin' on the interstate\nI'm fightin' fate\nAnd, Lord, I hate that I ain't close to you\n\nI'm cuttin' ties with things that bind my heart to this world\nI love you and I'm willing, but I cannot keep you, girl\nPhilly by the morning and Ohio by the night\nThe thing about high hopes is you can't hold on too tight"}
