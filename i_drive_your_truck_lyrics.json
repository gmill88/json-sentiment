{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson I Drive Your Truck par Lee Brice\r\nEighty-Nine Cents in the ash tray\nHalf empty bottle of Gatorade rolling in the floorboard\nThat dirty Braves cap on the dash\nDog tags hangin\u2019 from the rear view\nOld Skoal can, and cowboy boots and a Go Army Shirt folded in the back\nThis thing burns gas like crazy, but that\u2019s alright\nPeople got their ways of coping\nOh, and I\u2019ve got mine\n\nI drive your truck\nI roll every window down\nAnd I burn up\nEvery back road in this town\n\nI find a field, I tear it up\nTil all the pain\u2019s a cloud of dust\nYeah, sometimes I drive your truck\n\nI leave that radio playing\nThat same ole country station where ya left it\nYeah, man I crank it up\nAnd you\u2019d probably punch my arm right now\nIf you saw this tear rollin\u2019 down on my face\nHey, man I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to be tough\nAnd momma asked me this morning\nIf I\u2019d been by your grave\nBut that flag and stone ain\u2019t where I feel you anyway\n\nI drive your truck\nI roll every window down\nAnd I burn up\n\nEvery back road in this town\nI find a field, I tear it up\nTil all the pain\u2019s a cloud of dust\nYeah, sometimes I drive your truck\n\nI\u2019ve cussed, I\u2019ve prayed, I\u2019ve said goodbye\nShook my fist and asked God why\nThese days when I\u2019m missing you this much\n\nI drive your truck\nI roll every window down\nAnd I burn up\nEvery back road in this town\nI find a field, I tear it up\nTil all the pain\u2019s a cloud of dust\nYeah, sometimes, brother sometimes\n\nI drive your truck\n\nI drive your truck\nI hope you don\u2019t mind, I hope you don\u2019t mind\nI drive your truck"}
