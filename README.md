## Requests, JSON, and basic NLP with spaCy
### Name: Graham Miller

## Project Goal
The goal of this exercise is to access web hosted APIs, and get back a response in JSON format and access the information we need from the JSON. 

## Introduction
In this Project, we will analyze the sentiment of both poems and song lyrics using an NLP. This is accomplished by using spaCy and TextBlob to process song lyrics and calculate a polarity score based on the positivity or negativity of the lyrics.
