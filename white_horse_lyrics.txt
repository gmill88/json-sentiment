{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson White Horse par Chris Stapleton\r\n\nThis love is getting kinda dangerous\nFeels like it's a loaded gun\nMy-my, it's turning like a cloud of dust\nMy heart always wants to run\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh\nIf you want a cowboy on a white horse\nRidin' off into the sunset\nIf that's the kinda love you wanna wait for\nHold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet\nNo, I ain't there yet\nNo, I ain't there yet\n\nWhite horse\n\n\nSomeday, maybe you could have your way\nRight now's just not the time\nSome things a man's just got to do\nI wish you could change my mind\n\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh\nIf you want a cowboy on a white horse\nRidin' off into the sunset\nIf that's the kinda love you wanna wait for\nHold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet\nNo, I ain't there yet\nNo, I ain't there yet\n\nWhite horse\n\nIf you want a cowboy on a white horse\nRidin' off into the sunset\n\nIf that's the kinda love you wanna wait for\nHold on tight, girl, I ain't there\nIf you want a cowboy on a white horse\nRidin' off into the sunset\nIf that's the kinda love you wanna wait for\nHold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet\nNo, I ain't there yet\nNo, I ain't there yet\n\n\nWhite horse"}
