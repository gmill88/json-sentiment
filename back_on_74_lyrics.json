{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Back On 74 par Jungle\r\n[Lydia Kitto]\nYou keep me walking on the same line\nWhen we get high on my breaktime\nAnd we're just watching from the same town\nBut that don't change when it breakdown\nThen we were talking 'bout the same crime\nNo, it don't hurt when it rains now\nLearnt my lesson at the same time\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ohh where did it-\n\nGo? Back on 74 (When I noticed you)\nCall this place my home\nNever gonna cry anymore\nWhere did it all\n\n(Ooh, oh, oh-oh)\n\n(Ooh, oh, oh-oh)\n(Ooh, oh, oh-oh)\n(Ooh, oh, oh-oh)\n\n[Lydia Kitto]\nYou keep me walking on the same line\nWhen we get high on my breaktime\nAnd we're just watching from the same town\nBut that don't change when it breakdown\nThen we were talking 'bout the same crime\nNo, it don't hurt when it rains now\nLearnt my lesson at the same time\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ohh where did it-\n\nGo?
