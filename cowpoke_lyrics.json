{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Cowpoke par Colter Wall\r\nI'm lonesome but happy\nRich but I'm broke\nAnd the good Lord knows the reason\nI'm just a cowpoke\n\nFrom Cheyenne to Douglas\nThe ranges I know\nCause I drift with the wind\nNo one cares where I go\n\nI ain't got a dime\nIn these ol' wore out jeans\nSo I'll stop eating steak\nAnd go back to beans\n\nI'll pick up a ten spot\n\nIn Prescott I know\nRidin' the broncs\nIn the big rodeo\n\nSome evening in springtime\nA filly I'll find\nAnd I might spend all summer\nWith her on my mind\n\nBut I'll never be branded\nAnd never be broke\nI'm a carefree, range riding\nDrifting cowpoke"}
