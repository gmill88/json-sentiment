{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Northern Attitude par Noah Kahan\r\nBreathin' in, breathin' out\nHow you been? You settled down?\nYou feelin' right? You feelin' proud?\nHow are your kids? Where are they now?\n\nYou build a boat, you build a life\nYou lose your friends, you lose your wife\nYou settle in to routine\nWhere are you? What does it mean?\n\nIf I get too close and I'm not how you hoped\nForgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised out in the cold\nIf the sun don't rise 'til the summertime\nForgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised on little light\n\n\nBought some shit, search online\nYou're gettin' lost, you're gettin' high\nAll alone late in life\nScared to live, scared to die\n\nYou build a boat, you build a life\nYou lose your kids, you lose your wife\nYou settle down, you're feelin' lost\nYou're gettin' stoned, then kickin' rocks (One, two, three, four)\n\nIf I get too close and I'm not how you hoped\nForgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised out in the cold\nIf the sun don't rise 'til the summertime\nForgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised on little light\n\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah-ah\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah-ah\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah-ah (Oh)\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah-ah (Oh)\n\nIf I get too close and I'm not how you hoped\nForgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised out in the cold\nIf the sun don't shine 'til the summertime\nForgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised on little light\n\nSick"}
